#  2020-05-06 - changed time.mktime to calendar.timegm in line:
#                wsprSpotTimeStamp = int( calendar.timegm( wsprSpotDateTime.timetuple() ) )
#             - this was a bug reported by Bob ZL1RS which identified a problem with local time vs UTC time
#               conversion.

aprsWsprBridge.py is the main script and has been tested only on Python 3 and Windows but should be OK Linux with few if any changes.

Requires aprsUtilities.py, getLastAprsPositonTime.py and getWspr.py

You will need a aprs api key form aprs.fi getting one is simple, just create an account aprs.fi if you already do not have one.

You will find your aprs api key under your account details

see: https://aprs.fi/page/api you will need to create and account and you will find your key here: https://aprs.fi/account/

aprsWsprBridge.py is the only file you should need to edit.

Specifically in these place near the top of the file:

strUserCallSign = 'your callsign - the one who will be uploading the spot to APRS and has created and account on aprs.fi and has an aprs api key'

aprsApiKey = 'your aprs api key see: https://aprs.fi/page/api you will need to create and account and you will find your key here: "https://aprs.fi/account/"

strWsprCallSign = 'callsign of the wspr target i.e. W1XXX'

strBalloonCallSign = 'callsign you want your balloon to appear as on APRS i.e. W1XXX-12'

Place all of these files in the same folder, for example c:\apps\aprsWsprBridge\

The script will create two log files in this folder when it runs, one a general run time log and the other will contain a log of any wspr spot it
collects and uses to upload a position to aprs.fi.

You will need to set up a scheduled task to run aprsWsprBridge.py

I suggest no more frequently than once every 15 minutes and on and odd minut and seconds i.e. 00:03:17 or whatever. This gets away from the peak
wspr upload times on the even minutes.

Good luck.
